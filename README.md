# LiteLanguageModel

LiteLanguageModel is a simplified version of a large language model, developed with educational purposes in mind. It aims to provide insights into the inner workings of language processing using deep learning technologies, focusing on the core concepts of transformer architecture.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA Toolkit 11.2 or higher (if you plan to run the model on GPU)
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `torch`, `transformers`

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LiteLanguageModel.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   cd LiteLanguageModel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify the installation by running a simple test:

   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the model, including any scripts for training, testing, or inference. For example:

```bash
python train.py --data_path "data/my_dataset.txt" --epochs 5 --batch_size 32
```

## Tips

**Stay Updated**: If the TensorLite repository updates, you can update your submodule to the latest commit by:

```bash
git submodule update --remote TensorLite
git commit -am "Updated TensorLite submodule to latest"
git push
```

**Initialization for New Clones**: initialize and update the submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SyedAman/LiteLanguageModel.git
```
